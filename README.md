# Project Full Stack Automation
This project created to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in Automation Testing.
## About
My project demonstates a smart automation infrastructure. It is built in hierarchy order of modules. The modules contain number of classes with methods. There are main/common/helpers/actions/page_object modules. In this way, the tests can be created in very simple way with a minimum lines of code. Also the infrastructure allows to work with differend kinds of applications. Big advantage of the infrastructure is that it can be easy maintained!
## Project Overview
The project is an example of infrastructure for automation testing of different kinds of applications:

* Web based application
* DataBase
* Mobile application
* Web API
* Electron application
* Desktop application
## Infrastructure project includes using of:
* Page Object Design Pattern
* Project Layers(Extensions/Work Flows/Test Cases...)
* Support of Different Clients/Browsers
* Failure Mechanism
* Common Functionality
* External Files Support
* Reporting System (including screenshots)
* Visual Testing
* DB support
* CI support
## List of applications were used in this project:
* Grafana Webpage - Web based application
*  API Demos - Mobile application
* Grafana API - Web API
* Electron - TodoList application
* Windows calculator - Desktop application
* DataBase - GrafanaDB
 ## Tools & Frameworks used in the project:
 * TestNG - Testing Framework
* Listeners - interface used to generate logs and customize the TestNG reports
* MySQL Free Online DB - used for login to Grafana web page
* Jenkins- for tests execution
* REST Assured - for API testing
* Allure Reports - as the main reporting system
## Tests Execution:
Each of the applications has a few tests for demonstration purpose. These tests can be developed in a very simple way, due to a lot of work with the infrastructure. [Sanity Tests]

## Known Issues:
Sometimes can be conflicts with some dependencies the applications are using. Hence, the project is for DEMO purpose only. In production it should be divided into several projects.
